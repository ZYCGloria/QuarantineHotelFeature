                    <h3>Inside the quarantine hotels that build up China’s Covid-zero defense

                    </h3>
                    <hr />
                    <p>As China battles the recent flare-up of Covid-19 cases, Wang Xudong, manager of Shanghai Sea Cube
                        International Hotel, felt unexpectedly relieved. His hotel began to see its revenue soar after
                        suffering losses for months as a quarantine spot.
                    </p>

                    <p>There are tens of thousands of hotels in China experiencing similar countercyclical situations
                        after deciding to become quarantine hotels——providing centralized medical observation for
                        inbound travelers and local close contacts. These quarantine hotels are providing strong support
                        for China's covid-zero policy, but they are not able to find the backing to support their future
                        development.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Our business is always inverse to the pandemic, no one knows what will happen tomorrow,” said
                        Wang, whose hotel went from just 15% occupancy to 100% because of the recent case surge. "We are
                        struggling to survive and have no idea how this will end.“
                    </p>
                    <p>China set its GDP growth target for 2022 at around 5.5%, which was the lowest in 30 years and has
                        gone under even more pressure because of the recent surge in cases. The battered tourism and
                        hotel industry reflects the broader pain China's economy faces as it continues the
                        zero-tolerance approach when other countries shift to living with Covid.
                    </p>
                    <p>This has prompted hotels, including listed companies like Zhejiang SSAW Boutique Hotels Co.,
                        Shanghai Jin Jiang International Hotels Co., and BTG Hotels Group Co., to explore new
                        “quarantine business models” to prevent closures due to dismal business conditions. However, the
                        social costs, along with the uncertainty of the pandemic, have left the hotels unsure of their
                        future.
                    </p>
                    <p>China experienced several large-scale lockdowns following the Covid-19 outbreak in early 2020,
                        which greatly restricted population movement. After more than half a year of stabilization with
                        sporadic cases, outbreaks recurred in the first and third quarters of 2021, continuing to hit
                        the occupancy and performance of many hotels.

                    <p>The average occupancy rate of domestic star hotels in the first quarter of 2020 plummeted to 23%,
                        less than half of the number in the same period last year. In addition, the star hotel revenue
                        nationwide in 2021 and 2020 fell by 29% and 38% respectively compared to 2019.
                    </p>

                    <p>Zhao Cheng’s hotel in Hangzhou has been taking normal business in 2020, but barely stayed afloat.
                        In early 2021, his hotel finally made the difficult decision to transition to a quarantine
                        hotel.
                    </p>

                    <p>"Even with single-digit cases, it can take two to three months for local hotels to get back to
                        normal, and months of earning will be lost,” Zhao said.
                    </p>

                    <p>In this state of anxiety and helplessness, more and more hotels apply to become temporary
                        quarantine areas.
                    </p>

                    <p>Zhao said that becoming a quarantine hotel saved him from the edge of bankruptcy and increased
                        the occupancy rate by 70%. “Stable customer sources and cash flow are so important when
                        everything is uncertain.”
                    </p>

                    <p>Zhejiang SSAW Boutique Hotels Co. has a total of 18 self-operated hotels, with three of them
                        being used as quarantine hotels since March 2020. Throughout 2020, the occupancy rates at the
                        three quarantine hotels remained above 90%, while the rates at other hotels hovered between 10%
                        and 40%, according to the company's financial statements.
                    </p>

                    <p>"Although the room rates are lower, quarantine hotels have the advantage of high occupancy rates
                        and low operating costs such as labor and consumables," the company said in its prospectus. With
                        these advantages, the three quarantine hotels together contributed 46% to the company's net
                        profit in 2020, far exceeding other hotels.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, the company saw a decline in its performance in the third quarter of 2021—recording
                        revenue of 65 million yuan, down 17% from the same period last year, and a net profit of 7.5
                        million yuan, down 46%.
                    </p>
                    <p>"Repeated outbreaks in the third quarter of 2021 led to a sharp drop in travel, which was the
                        main reason for the poor performance of the company's other normally operating hotels," said
                        Peter Chen, an analyst at Southwest Securities. "However, this also shows that the company's
                        performance, which relies on such a ‘special matter’ as quarantine hotels, is not sustainable.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Shanghai Jin Jiang International Hotels Co. is another hotel giant
                        getting into the quarantine
                        business. The company has 548 quarantine hotels as of the end of September 2021, with a majority
                        of them being budget hotels.

                    <p>“Mid-end hotels are recovering better than budget hotels,“ said Zhou Qidong, an expert in hotel
                        management. "It is a good strategy to have some budget hotels that have been hit hard by the
                        epidemic to be quarantine hotels, which can increase their occupancy rates and revenues, and
                        help improve the overall resilience of the group."
                    </p>

                    <p>The survival of a quarantine hotel is inseparable from the financial support of the government,
                        which fully or partially subsidize the hotel's vacant rooms. However, the growing number of
                        quarantine hotels is putting a strain on the Chinese government's budget.

                    <p>China’s Healthcare Expenditure in 2021 reached 1.92 trillion yuan, about 15% higher than in 2019.
                        Among that, the Public Health Expenditure, which is directly related to epidemic prevention and
                        control, rose about 75% from 2019.
                    </p>

                    <p>Despite the huge expenditure, government subsidies are far from enough for many quarantine
                        hotels.
                    </p>

                    <p>Zhao said that due to the volatile number of quarantined people, the hotel still had to deal with
                        a lot of empty rooms and losses from time to time.
                    </p>
                    <p>"Sometimes I even want time to stand still in this era of the pandemic," Zhao said helplessly.
                        "Otherwise I would have probably lost my hotel.”
